# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy RKHelperModule into your `modules` directory. Afterwards you should have a folder named `modules/RK/HelperModule/Resources`.
2. Initialize and activate RKHelperModule in the extensions administration.
3. Move or copy the directory `Resources/userdata/RKHelperModule/` to `/userdata/RKHelperModule/`.
   Note this step is optional as the install process can create these folders, too.
